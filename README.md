**Olympics Data Visualization Project**

This project involves the analysis and visualization of the Olympics dataset using Tableau. The dataset includes historical records of the modern Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016, 
allowing for an in-depth exploration of trends in athlete performance, gender participation, and the correlation between economic indicators and Olympic success.

This project explores several questions:

How has the participation of women in sports evolved?
What is the correlation between a country's GDP growth rate and its Olympic medal count?
How does an athlete's age relate to their performance?
Who are the top athletes in terms of medal count, and in which sports?
Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

To visualize the changing trends in women's participation in the Olympics.
To analyze the relationship between a country's economic development and its Olympic success.
To explore the correlation between age and performance in Olympic athletes.
